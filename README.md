# PORTFOLIO


## ABOUT ME
My name is Beata Łapińska. I have been working in the QA industry for about 5 years now. I have started as a Localistation QA tester for Polish and English languages in Video Game industry. As I was interested in a bit of a change from video games into more of a software development field, I am now working as a QA engineer for ERGO ET&S where I focus on testing apps on mobile devices, both Android and iOS platforms.
From August 2023, I have been promoted to the position of Test Manager within the company.

So far, I had the opportunity to work as a LQA technician and LQA Project lead on many successfully released titles for numerous companies e.g. Square Enix (Outriders, Marvel's Avengers, Just Cause 4, Shadow of the Tomb Raider), Capcom (Monster Hunter: Iceborne, Monster Hunter), Devolver Digital (Witcheye), Curve Digital (American Fugitive).

My goal is to continue developing my technical and software testing skills as well as learning more about the backstage of software development to improve my understanding of the software development field.
